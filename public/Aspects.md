# Aspects

## Mind
The aspect of Mind is the embodiment of knowledge and experience. Knowledge could be gained from any number of sources, from books to teachers to secrets whispered by the universe. Experience, on the other hand, usually involves personal action and practical application of knowledge. However, one cannot exist without the other, as knowledge can be gained while experiencing life and life can be experienced through the pursuit of knowledge.

Those strong of Mind are more often drawn towards logic or emotion rather than brute strength. A person with a high Mind aspect might be:
* powerful arcane sorcerers, able to control any number of natural or unnatural phenomenon
* masterful psychics who can control the very fabric of thought and reality
* excellent problem-solvers, lightning-quick in their ability to perceive the answer to a difficult problem or the best way out of a sticky situation
* gifted linguists well-versed in a vast array of tongues
* a skilled diplomat capable of making even the worse deals seem fair

# Aspects

## Mind
The aspect of Mind is the embodiment of knowledge and understanding. Knowledge could be gained from any number of sources, from books to teachers to secrets whispered by the universe. Understanding, on the other hand, usually involves personal action and practical application of knowledge. However, one cannot exist without the other, as knowledge can be gained while journeying toward understanding and understanding can be acquired through the pursuit of knowledge.

Those strong of Mind are more often drawn towards logic or emotion rather than brute strength. A person with a high Mind aspect might be:
* powerful arcane sorcerers, able to control any number of natural or unnatural phenomenon
* masterful psychics who can control the very fabric of thought and reality
* excellent problem-solvers, lightning-quick in their ability to perceive the answer to a difficult problem or the best way out of a sticky situation
* gifted linguists well-versed in a vast array of tongues
* a skilled diplomat armed with knowledge of the person they are about to enter negotiations with

## Body
The aspect of Body can be described in two words: hard work. Hard work can be grueling exercise routines, extreme , or even endless 
To be the strongest, the fastest, the toughest is what drive those strong of Body to push themselves further and further. And when they reach that peak of performance they've been striving for? They set a new goal even higher than the first.

# Aspects

## Mind
The aspect of Mind is the embodiment of knowledge and understanding. Knowledge could be gained from any number of sources, from books to teachers to secrets whispered by the universe. Understanding, on the other hand, usually involves personal action and practical application of knowledge. However, one cannot exist without the other, as knowledge can be gained while journeying toward understanding and understanding can be acquired through the pursuit of knowledge.

Those strong of Mind are more often drawn towards logic or emotion rather than brute strength. A person with a high Mind aspect might be:
* a powerful arcane sorcerers, able to control any number of natural or unnatural phenomenon
* a masterful psychics who can control the very fabric of thought and reality
* an excellent problem-solvers, lightning-quick in their ability to perceive the answer to a difficult problem or the best way out of a sticky situation
* a gifted linguists well-versed in a vast array of tongues
* a skilled diplomat armed with knowledge of the person they are about to enter negotiations with

## Body
The aspect of Body can be described in two words: hard work. Hard work can be grueling exercise routines, extreme discipline, or even endless nights of study.
To be the strongest, the fastest, the toughest is what drives those strong of Body to push themselves further and further. And when they reach that peak of performance they've been striving for? They set a new goal even higher than the first. 

A person with high Body favors the physical over the esoteric, but that doesn't mean they're stupid. Such a person might be:
* a unshakable martial arts expert looking for an ever-stronger opponent
* a daring track star aiming to break a world record
* a down-to-earth construction worker simply trying to feed their family
* a desperate blood mage who believes they have no choice but to resort to what some might call dark magic
* a sublime wielder of elemental power seeking master the craft of shaping the world
* a street thug who just likes to pick fights

## Soul
The aspect of Soul is a measure of inner strength and attunement to the universe at large. This might mean that a person is devoted to a certain faith, is a good judge of people and character, or simply has an intuitive grasp on people of the universe as a whole.

Someone excelling in Soul might be:
* a pious divine healer channeling the grace of their god
* a righteous paladin wielding the fury of their god to smite their enemies
* a hard-working detective who trusts his gut more than his senses


Divine Magics, metaphysical skills, gut feeling.

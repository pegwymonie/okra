# Aspects

## Mind
The aspect of Mind is the embodiment of knowledge and experience. Knowledge could be gained from any number of sources, from books to teachers to secrets whispered by the universe. Experience, on the other hand, usually involves personal action and practical application of knowledge. However, one cannot exist without the other, as knowledge can be gained while experiencing life and life can be experienced through the pursuit of knowledge.

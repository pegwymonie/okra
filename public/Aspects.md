# Aspects

## Mind
The aspect of Mind is the embodiment of knowledge and understanding. Knowledge could be gained from any number of sources, from books to teachers to secrets whispered by the universe. Understanding, on the other hand, usually involves personal action and practical application of knowledge. However, one cannot exist without the other, as knowledge can be gained while journeying toward understanding and understanding can be acquired through the pursuit of knowledge.

Those strong of Mind are more often drawn towards logic or emotion rather than brute strength. A person with a high Mind aspect might be:
* a powerful arcane sorcerers, able to control any number of natural or unnatural phenomenon
* a masterful psychics who can control the very fabric of thought and reality

## Body
The aspect of Body can be described in two words: hard work. Hard work can be grueling exercise routines, extreme discipline, or even endless nights of study.
To be the strongest, the fastest, the toughest is what drives those strong of Body to push themselves further and further. And when they reach that peak of performance they've been striving for? They set a new goal even higher than the first. 

A person with high Body favors the physical over the esoteric, but that doesn't mean they're stupid. Such a person might be:
* a unshakable martial arts expert looking for an ever-stronger opponent

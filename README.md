# Tenants


The primary purpose of role-playing games is to provide all members of a group enjoyment through role-play.
Players must be given tools to create a character that they find enjoyable, and unconstrained by the system.
Players must be also able to understand the rules, requiring a simple set of rules guiding the complexity many people desire. 
Players must finally be able to execute the rules in a quick, concise, and consistent manner. 

* Individuals and Interactions before Rules
    * Player interaction with the world should not be limited to those described in the rules. 
* Concepts over Exhaustive Rule sets 
    * The rules are provided at a broad conceptual level, allowing re-interpretation as the situation demands. 
* Collaboration over Control
    * All members are on the same side, crafting a story everyone can enjoy. 
* Responding to change over Planning Everything
    * Shit happens. The rules don't cover everything, have fun!

* No more than 3 dice. 
* Max dice d12. 
* Even Ranks are rolled with the appropriate dice. (2 = d2...12 = d12)
* Odd Ranks are rolled with the highest appropriate dice, with a positive modifier equal to the missing ranks. (1 = 1...11 = d10 + 1)

# Stats
---
Aspects:
* Dice
* Ranks (1-12)
* Starts at 2, caps at 12. 1 represents a total disability. zero represent an entire lack. (Constructs have a soul of zero). 
* Attacks target a specific attribute based on their source. ie and attack with a physical weapon targets body, a psychic attack targets mind, and a divine attack targets soul.

Aptitudes:
* Dice

* Short list
* Ranks cannot exceeded power-level + 2

Techniques:

* Expansive
* Cost a certain about of exp points
* Represents the class features from other systems, as well as feats from other systems.
* Can have multiple levels. 
* Benefits might not start at the first rank.
* Ranks cannot exceeded power-level + 2


Skills:
* Very Expansive.
* Must be used with a tool.
* 3 Ranks (Proficient, Expert, Master )
  * Rank 1 reduces tool usage difficulty by one.
  * Rank 2 reduces tool usage difficulty by two.
  * Rank 3 reduces tool usage difficulty by three, you win ties, and you may anchor one step of your CPL die.
* Each Level of Skill applies to a smaller subset of an item group.
  * Proficient: Long Bladed Weapons
  * Trained: Bastard Swords
  * Master: John Black Smith's Bastard Sword (A single Item.)

Character Power Level (CPL)
* Dice
    * Only Applied on actions with using a techniques and/or skill. 
* Total of all values(Attributes, Aptitudes, Techniques, and Skills.)
* Levels as Follows
    * 36 ->  1 (d2)
    * 48 ->  2 (d4)
    * 72 ->  3 (d6)
    * 128 -> 4 (d8)
    * 192 -> 5 (d10)
    * 256 -> 6 (d12)


Advancement:
* Advancement is done all in character using time, money, experience, influence, or some combination of the previous.
* Stats take a number of lessons to advance equal to twice the current value.

Lessons:
* lessons are how characters grow and learn
* lessons are assigned to a specific statictic when they are earned. 
* Aptitudes, Skills, and Proficienies require double the next rank value of experience to advance.
* Aspects require triple the next rank value of experience to advance.

Natual Lessons:
* You can earn lesson by performing actions including the stat. 
  * When you fail or succeed on a roll, but not critical fail or critical succeed, you gain a lesson in **one** stat used in the roll.
    * Make a note of the amount you surpassed or missed by as the difficulty of the lesson.
    * Make a note of the attribute and, if any, aptitude used.
    * Make a note of which ( Attribute, Aptitude, Technique, or Skill ) the lesson will be for. 

Trained Lessons:
* You receive training in a statistic, this can be resolved immediately not counting towards the number of lessons per time period. 
    * The training will dictate:
        * The difficulty of the lesson.
        * What aptitude it targets.
        * Which attribute it uses. 

Resolving Lessons:
* At the end of a session, or when ever there is more than a day of downtime you may:
    * Resolve number lessons learned equal to your twice your character power level (GM's might modify this if a lot has happened. General Rule is (CPL*Scene)):
        * Make a roll with the used attribute, adding half the aptitude ranks if applicable, using twice the difficulty of the lesson.
            * A Successful role provides one experience. 
            * A Critical Success provides two experience.
            * A Critical failure provides a sense of deep disappointment.
    * Carry forward a number of un-resolved lessons equal to 4 times your character level, any not carried forward are lost. 

Aspect Spending:
* Actions may require you to spend an aspect to use them.
* This spending represents a over-excertion of the aspect, "pushing" your self.

Aspect Spending (Health Simple):
* You take one damage in the pool corresponding to the aspect.
* This does not tigger any effects that occur when taking damage.

Aspect Spending (Wounds):
* You recieve the below wound:
	* Exhaustion( *Aspect*)
		* Effect: -1 *aspect* rank
		* Cure: Short Rest
* This does not tigger any effects that occur when taking wounds.

Health (Simple):
* Each aspect has its own health/resource pool.
  * Three times the aspect rank.
* If the pool is reduced to zero:
    * Actions can no longer spend this aspect
    * Total of -4 for actions using the attribute
* If the pool goes negative:
    * by more that your rank in the attribute, you fall unconscious.
    * by more than twice your rank in the attribute, you being dying (See Dying).
    
Health (Wounds):
* When an attack is successful you take a wound based on the attack.
* Wounds apply penalties.
    * If a penalty would reduce an attribute to zero, you fall unconscious.
    * If you receive a number of would greater than 3 times your character level you begin dying.  

Dying (Easy):
* Every round make a check(# TODO: Add Check) vs the current penalty, this check is not effected by health penalties. (Simple: 4, Wounds: highest attribute negative)
    * On Success you return to being unconscious.
    * If you fail this check a number of times equal to your character level, you die. 

Dying (Hard):
* Characters who remain dying for any amount of time risk permanent damage.
* When a character starts dying they begin losing ranks in stats.
    * The first minute a character is dying they temporarily lose ranks equal to their power level.
    * For every minute beyond the first they permanently lose ranks equal to half their power level.
    * This loss halts after a number of minutes equal to their power level + 1. They cannot be revived by mundane means at this point.
    * Do not resolve these losses until a character is revived, it might be possible to mitigate certain losses. 
    
Losing Stats:
* Temporary loses are present until a character has rested with no health penalties. 
* Permanent loses are marked off the character sheet. 
    * If there is a lower rank, you retain half the experience needed to advance.
    * If there is no lower rank, you lose all experience.
* Roll a d20 for each lost rank:
    * 1: Highest attribute.
    * 2: Highest skill.
    * 3: Highest technique.
    * 4: Highest proficiency.
    * 5-10: Pick 6 skills/techniques, roll d6 to determine loss.
    * 11-15: Pick 6 proficiencies, roll d6 to determine loss.
    * 16-19: Players choice.
    * 20: Lose any one step. 
    
# Mechanics
---
Checks:
* Targets a certain difficulty.
* Meeting the difficulty means the action succeeds.
* Beating the difficulty by more than 6 is a critical success.
* Rolling the max result on more than half the dice automatically counts as a critical success, if the result would have been a normal success.
* A Critical failure occurs when you miss the check by 6, or more than half the dice roll their minimum value, excluding dice who's maximum value is one.   

Dice Anchoring:
* Rolls can be modified by effects to have an anchored value. 
* This reduces the size of the dice rolled by one step, and provides a +2 to the roll.
* This anchors a portion of the dice's potential value. 



Movement:
* You must take a action to move. 
* You get an amount of movement equal to 2 + your Body, but you may perform check against the total distance you wish to move if is in more than this amount.
  * Failing this check makes you winded for a number of rounds equal to amount you missed the check by plus 1, Conferring a -1 to all actions. 
  * Your movement falls short, equal to the amount you failed plus one. 

Rounds:
* 1 Action per turn with out penalty.
* 2 Actions can be combined into a single action if they do not rely on the same parts of the body.
	* If one of the actions is trivial, there is no aditional penalty.
	* If one action requires no check, the other action takes a -1.
	* If both actions require checks, they both take -2.
  * When two actions are combined they are resolved at the same time. 
	  * Negative effects caused by failures are applied to the other check, if there is a conflict the worst effect occurs first.
	  * IE, if you fail to gain extra movement with a movement action, the penalty for winded is applied to the action it was combined with. 
	  * (This can cause some pretty bad outcomes, if you say failed to move and that caused you to strain your self in another action, both negative outcomes would feed into each other )
* You may take an additional action a turn, it confers either a -2 on all actions being taken, or a -5 on the additional action being taken.
    * This must be declared at the start of the turn, otherwise the additional action takes a -6 and is considered a **snap** action.
    
Attacks:
* Target specific attributes, acting as a check vs the targets difficulty for that attribute. 
* The standard difficulty to hit a stat is the double value of the stat.
* A hit allows the attack effect to happen.
* Missing the check causes the attack to miss the intended target. 


# Tools

Tools are used to help with actions. Tools have two ways of being benificial:
* Providing rank bonus'es
* Reducing difficulties of actions

# Tenants


The primary purpose of role-playing games is to provide all members of a group enjoyment through role-play.
Players must be given tools to create a character that they find enjoyable, and unconstrained by the system.
Players must be also able to understand the rules, requiring a simple set of rules guiding the complexity many people desire. 
Players must finally be able to execute the rules in a quick, concise, and consistent manner. 

* Individuals and Interactions before Rules
    * Player interaction with the world should not be limited to those described in the rules. 
* Concepts over Exhaustive Rule sets 
    * The rules are provided at a broad conceptual level, allowing re-interpretation as the situation demands. 
* Collaboration over Control
    * All members are on the same side, crafting a story everyone can enjoy. 
* Responding to change over Planning Everything
    * Shit happens. The rules don't cover everything, have fun!

* No more than 3 dice. 
* Max dice d12. 
* Even Ranks are rolled with the appropriate dice. (2 = d2...12 = d12)
* Odd Ranks are rolled with the highest appropriate dice, with a positive modifier equal to the missing ranks. (1 = 1...11 = d10 + 1)

# Stats
---
Attributes:

* Ranks (1-12)
* Body, Mind and Soul.
* Starts at 2, caps at 12. 1 represents a total disability. zero represent an entire lack. (Constructs have a soul of zero).

    * 128 -> 4 (d8)
    * 192 -> 5 (d10)
    * 256 -> 6 (d12)


Advancement:
* Advancement is done all in character using time, money, experience, influence, or some combination of the previous.
* Stats take a number of lessons to advance equal to twice the current value.

Natual Lessons:
* You can complete a lesson by performing actions including the stat. 
  * When you fail or succeed on a roll, but not critical fail or critical succeed, you may attempt to gain a lesson in **one** stat used in the roll.
    * Make a note of the amount you surpassed or missed by as the difficulty of the lesson.
    * Make a note of the attribute and, if any, aptitude used.
    * Make a note of which ( Attribute, Aptitude, Technique, or Skill ) the lesson will be for. 

Trained Lessons:
* You receive training in a statistic, this can be resolved immediately not counting towards the number of lessons per time period. 
    * The training will dictate:
        * The difficulty of the lesson.
        * What aptitude it targets.
        * Which attribute it uses. 

Resolving Lessons:
* At the end of a session, or when ever there is more than a day of downtime you may:
    * Resolve number lessons learned equal to your twice your character power level (GM's might modify this if a lot has happened. General Rule is (CPL*Scene)):
        * Make a roll with the used attribute, adding half the aptitude ranks if applicable, using twice the difficulty of the lesson.
            * A Successful role provides one lesson. 
            * A Critical Success provides two.
            * A Critical failure provides a sense of deep disappointment.
    * Carry forward a number of un-resolved lessons equal to 4 times your character level, any not carried forward are lost. 


Health (Simple):
* Each attribute has its own health/resource pool.
  * Three times the attribute rank.
* If the pool is reduced to zero:
    * Actions can no longer spend this attribute
    * Total of -4 for actions using the attribute
* If the pool goes negative:
    * by more that your rank in the attribute, you fall unconscious.
    * by more than twice your rank in the attribute, you being dying (See Dying).
    
Health (Wounds):
* When an attack is successful you take a wound based on the attack.
* Wounds apply penalties.
    * If a penalty would reduce an attribute to zero, you fall unconscious.
    * If you receive a number of would greater than 3 times your character level you begin dying.  

Dying (Easy):
* Every round make a check(# TODO: Add Check) vs the current penalty, this check is not effected by health penalties. (Simple: 4, Wounds: highest attribute negative)
    * On Success you return to being unconscious.
    * If you fail this check a number of times equal to your character level, you die. 

Dying (Hard):
* Characters who remain dying for any amount of time risk permanent damage.
* When a character starts dying they begin losing ranks in stats.
    * The first minute a character is dying they temporarily lose ranks equal to their power level.
    * For every minute beyond the first they permanently lose ranks equal to half their power level.
    * This loss halts after a number of minutes equal to their power level + 1. They cannot be revived by mundane means at this point.
    * Do not resolve these losses until a character is revived, it might be possible to mitigate certain losses. 
    
Losing Stats:
* Temporary loses are present until a character has rested with no health penalties. 
* Permanent loses are marked off the character sheet. 
    * If there is a lower rank, you are considered to have completed half the required steps to advance.
    * If there is no lower rank, you lose all steps.
* Roll a d20 for each lost rank:
    * 1: Highest attribute.
    * 2: Highest skill.
    * 3: Highest technique.
    * 4: Highest proficiency.
    * 5-10: Pick 6 skills/techniques, roll d6 to determine loss.
    * 11-15: Pick 6 proficiencies, roll d6 to determine loss.
    * 16-19: Players choice.
    * 20: Lose any one step. 
    
# Mechanics
---
Checks:
* Targets a certain difficulty.
* Meeting the difficulty means the action succeeds.
* Beating the difficulty by more than 6 is a critical success.
* Rolling the max result on more than half the dice automatically counts as a critical success, if the result would have been a normal success.
* A Critical failure occurs when you miss the check by 6, or more than half the dice roll their minimum value, excluding dice who's maximum value is one.   

Dice Anchoring:
* Rolls can be modified by effects to have an anchored value. 
* This reduces the size of the dice rolled by one step, and provides a +2 to the roll.
* This anchors a portion of the dice's potential value. 



Movement:
* You must take a action to move. 
* You get an amount of movement equal to 2 + your Body, but you may perform check against the total distance you wish to move if is in more than this amount.
  * Failing this check makes you winded for a number of rounds equal to amount you missed the check by plus 1, Conferring a -1 to all actions. 
  * Your movement falls short, equal to the amount you failed plus one. 

Rounds:
* 1 Action per turn.
* Each action can have a single trivial action performed with it for no penalty.
* 2 Actions can be combined into a single action if they do not rely on the same parts of the body, but both actions take a -2. (Moving, and Shooting.)
  * When two actions are combined they are resolved at the same time. 
  * Negative effects caused by failures are applied to the other check.
  * IE, if you fail to gain extra movement with a movement action, the penalty for winded is applied to the action it was combined with. 
  * (This can cause some pretty bad outcomes, if you say failed to move and that caused you to strain your self in another action, both negative outcomes would feed into each other )
* You may take an additional action a turn, it confers either a -2 on all actions being taken, or a -5 on the additional action being taken.
    * This must be declared at the start of the turn, otherwise the additional action takes a -6 and is considered a **snap** action.
    
Attacks:
* Target specific attributes, acting as a check vs the targets difficulty for that attribute. 
* The standard difficulty to hit a stat is the double value of the stat.
* A hit allows the attack effect to happen.
* Missing the check causes the attack to miss the intended target.

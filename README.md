# Stats
---
Attributes:
* Body, Mind and Soul.
* Starts at 2, caps at 12. 1 represents a total disability. zero represent an entire lack. (Constructs have a soul of zero). 
* Attacks target a specific attribute based on their source. ie and attack with a physical weapon targets body, a psychic attack targets mind, and a divine attack targets soul.
* Each has 3 states: Rigid, Flexible, and Balanced. 
* Attributes add their value to an action. (The action lists what attribute(s) can be used with it.)
* Attributes with a Balanced state provide a +1 bonus on any action.
* Attributes with a Rigid/Flexible state adds half their value as a bonus to actions that correspond. (Each action will
note which state of an attribute it corresponds to. If none are listed, the action is considered balanced, gaining only the 
standard +1 from a balanced state.)

Skills:
* Short list
* Has ranks. Each rank provides a die step. 
* Rank 1-12 (d1 - d12)
* Ranks cannot exceeded power-level + 1

Techniques:
* Expansive
* Cost a certain about of exp points
* Represents the class features from other systems, as well as feats from other systems.
* Can have multiple levels. 
* Benefits might not start at the first rank.

Proficiencies:
* Very Expansive.
* 3 Levels (Proficient, Trained, Mastered )
  * Proficient reduces difficulty by one
  * Trained allows you to split a dice.
  * Mastered allows you to split an additional time, and reduces the difficulty by a further 2
* Each Level of proficiencies applies to a smaller subset of an item group.
  * Proficient: Long Bladed Weapons
  * Trained: Bastard Swords
  * Master: John Black Smith's Bastard Sword (A single Item.)
  
Character Power Level
* Total of all values.
* Add a dice value based on level.


Advancement:
* Advancement is done all in character using time, money, experience, influence, or some combination of the previous.
* Stats take a number of steps to advance equal to 5 times the next value.
  * An attribute can only naturally gain one step per session. 
  * A skill can only naturally gain one step per session.
  * A Proficiencies can only naturally gain one step per scene.
  * A Techniques can only naturally gain one step per scene.
* You can gain steps naturally by performing actions including the stat. 
  * When you fail or succeed on a roll, but not critical fail or critical succeed, you may attempt to naturally gain a step in **one** stat used in the roll.  
  * Make a check, outside of normal rounds, using the same modifiers against the current value of the stat. 
     * If it succeeded, you gain a step in the advancement of that stat.
     * If it failed, you gain nothing.
     * If this would cause you to advance in level, this does not happen until the end of the current rounds.  
     * This check should be make outside of the flow of the normal round, as not to disrupt the game flow. 
     * Some GM's might request all of these learning opportunities be noted and handled after rounds.


Health:
* Each attribute has its own health/resource pool.
  * Three times the attribute value.
* Falling below half the maximum value imposes a -2 on all actions using that attribute
* Falling below zero adds a further -2 to all actions regardless of the attribute being used. 
    * Actions can no longer spend this attribute
    * Total of -4 for actions using the attribute
* Falling below half the negative maximum value causes you to lose complete control of the attribute, typically rendering you unconscious or otherwise unable to act.
* Falling to negative your maximum value causes you to lost function of that attribute. You begin Dying. See Dying.

Dying:
* When a health pool reaches a certain threshold a character begins dying. 
* Characters who remain dying for any amount of time risk permanent damage.
* When a character starts dying they begin losing ranks in stats.
    * The first minute a character is dying they temporarily lose ranks equal to their power level.
    * For every minute beyond the first they permanently lose ranks equal to half their power level.
    * This loss halts after a number of minutes equal to their power level + 1. They cannot be revived by mundane means at this point.
    * Do not resolve these losses until a character is revived, it might be possible to mitigate certain losses. 
    
Losing Stats:
* Temporary loses last until the next time your character rests, and has no missing health points in any pool.
* Permanent loses are marked off the character sheet. 
    * If there is a lower rank, you are considered to have completed half the required steps to advance.
    * If there is no lower rank, you lose all steps.
* Roll a d20 for each lost rank:
    * 1: Highest attribute.
    * 2: Highest skill.
    * 3: Highest technique.
    * 4: Highest proficiency.
    * 5-10: Pick 6 skills/techniques, roll d6 to determine loss.
    * 11-15: Pick 6 proficiencies, roll d6 to determine loss.
    * 16-19: Players choice.
    * 20: Lost any one step. 
    
# Mechanics
---
Checks:
* Targets a certain difficulty.
* Meeting the difficulty means the action succeeds.
* Beating the difficulty by more than 6 is a critical success.
* Rolling the max result on more than half the dice automatically counts as a critical success, if the result would have been a normal success.
* A Critical failure occurs when you miss the check by 6, or more than half the dice roll their minimum value, excluding dice who's maximum value is one.   

Movement:
* You must take a action to move. 
* You get an amount of movement equal to 2 + your Body, but you may perform check against the total distance you wish to move if is in more than this amount.
  * Failing this check makes you winded for a number of rounds equal to amount you missed the check by plus 1, Conferring a -1 to all actions. 
  * Your movement falls short, equal to the amount you failed plus one. 

Rounds:
* 1 Action per turn.
* Each action can have a single trivial action performed with it for no penalty.
* 2 Actions can be combined into a single action if they do not rely on the same parts of the body, but both actions take a -2. (Moving, and Shooting.)
  * When two actions are combined they are resolved at the same time. 
  * Negative effects caused by failures are applied to the other check.
  * IE, if you fail to gain extra movement with a movement action, the penalty for winded is applied to the action it was combined with. 
  * (This can cause some pretty bad outcomes, if you say failed to move and that caused you to strain your self in another action, both negative outcomes would feed into each other )
* You may take an additional action a turn, it confers either a -2 on all actions being taken, or a -5 on the additional action being taken.
    * This must be declared at the start of the turn, otherwise the additional action takes a -6 and is considered a **snap** action.
    
Attacks:
* Target specific attributes, acting as a check vs the targets difficulty for that attribute. 
* The standard difficulty to hit a stat is the double value of the stat.
* A hit allows the attack effect to happen.
* Missing the check causes the attack to miss the intended target.

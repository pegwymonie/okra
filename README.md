# Tenants


The primary purpose of role-playing games is to provide all members of a group enjoyment through role-play.
Players must be given tools to create a character that they find enjoyable, and unconstrained by the system.
Players must be also able to understand the rules, requiring a simple set of rules guiding the complexity many people desire. 
Players must finally be able to execute the rules in a quick, concise, and consistent manner. 

* Individuals and Interactions before Rules
    * Player interaction with the world should not be limited to those described in the rules. 
* Concepts over Exhaustive Rule sets 
    * The rules are provided at a broad conceptual level, allowing re-interpretation as the situation demands. 
* Collaboration over Control
    * All members are on the same side, crafting a story on the fly. 
* Responding to change over Planning Everything
    * Shit happens. The rules don't cover everything, have fun!

* No more than 3 dice. 
* Max dice d12. 
* Even Ranks are rolled with the appropriate dice. (2 = d2...12 = d12)
* Odd Ranks are rolled with the highest appropriate dice, with a positive modifier equal to the missing ranks. (1 = 1...11 = d10 + 1)

# Stats
---
Attributes:
* Dice
* Ranks (1-12)
* Body, Mind and Soul.
* Starts at 2, caps at 12. 1 represents a total disability. zero represent an entire lack. (Constructs have a soul of zero). 
* Attacks target a specific attribute based on their source. ie and attack with a physical weapon targets body, a psychic attack targets mind, and a divine attack targets soul.

Aptitudes:
* Dice
* Ranks (1-12)
* Short list
* Ranks cannot exceeded power-level + 2

Techniques:
* No Dice
* Ranks (1-12)
* Expansive
* Cost a certain about of exp points
* Represents the class features from other systems, as well as feats from other systems.
* Can have multiple levels. 
* Benefits might not start at the first rank.
* Ranks cannot exceeded power-level + 2


Skills:
* Very Expansive.
* 3 Levels (Proficient, Trained, Mastered )
  * Proficient reduces usage difficulty by one.
  * Trained reduces usage difficulty by two.
  * Mastered reduces usage difficulty by three, you win ties.
* Each Level of Skill applies to a smaller subset of an item group.
  * Proficient: Long Bladed Weapons
  * Trained: Bastard Swords
  * Master: John Black Smith's Bastard Sword (A single Item.) 
    * You can have a number of Proficiencies at master equal to double your power-level.
  
Character Power Level
* Dice
    * Only Applied on actions with using a techniques and/or skill. 
* Total of all values(Attributes, Aptitudes, Techniques, and Skills.
* Levels as Follows
    * 36 ->  1 (d2)
    * 48 ->  2 (d4)
    * 72 ->  3 (d6)
    * 128 -> 4 (d8)
    * 192 -> 5 (d10)
    * 256 -> 6 (d12)


Advancement:
* Advancement is done all in character using time, money, experience, influence, or some combination of the previous.
* Stats take a number of lessons to advance equal to twice the current value.
* You can complete a lesson by performing actions including the stat. 
  * When you fail or succeed on a roll, but not critical fail or critical succeed, you may attempt to gain a lesson in **one** stat used in the roll.
    * Make a note of the amount you surpassed or missed by as the difference.
    * Make a note of the attribute and, if any, aptitude used.
    * Make a note of which ( Attribute, Aptitude, Technique, or Skill ) the lesson will be for. 
* At the end of a session, or when ever there is downtime you may calculate a number lessons learned equal to your twice your character power level (GM's might modify this if a lot has happened. General Rule is (CPL*Scene)):
    * Make a roll with the used attribute, using twice the difference as the difficulty. Aptitude reduces the difficulty by half its max value.
        * A Successful role provides one lesson. 
        * A Critical Success provides two.
        * A Critical failure provides a sense of deep disappointment. 



Health:
* Each attribute has its own health/resource pool.
  * Three times the attribute value.
* Falling below half the maximum value imposes a -2 on all actions using that attribute
* Falling below zero adds a further -2 to all actions regardless of the attribute being used. 
    * Actions can no longer spend this attribute
    * Total of -4 for actions using the attribute
* Falling below half the negative maximum value causes you to lose complete control of the attribute, typically rendering you unconscious or otherwise unable to act.
* Falling to negative your maximum value causes you to lost function of that attribute. You begin Dying. See Dying.

Dying:
* When a health pool reaches a certain threshold a character begins dying. 
* Characters who remain dying for any amount of time risk permanent damage.
* When a character starts dying they begin losing ranks in stats.
    * The first minute a character is dying they temporarily lose ranks equal to their power level.
    * For every minute beyond the first they permanently lose ranks equal to half their power level.
    * This loss halts after a number of minutes equal to their power level + 1. They cannot be revived by mundane means at this point.
    * Do not resolve these losses until a character is revived, it might be possible to mitigate certain losses. 
    
Losing Stats:
* Temporary loses last until the next time your character rests, and has no missing health points in any pool.
* Permanent loses are marked off the character sheet. 
    * If there is a lower rank, you are considered to have completed half the required steps to advance.
    * If there is no lower rank, you lose all steps.
* Roll a d20 for each lost rank:
    * 1: Highest attribute.
    * 2: Highest skill.
    * 3: Highest technique.
    * 4: Highest proficiency.
    * 5-10: Pick 6 skills/techniques, roll d6 to determine loss.
    * 11-15: Pick 6 proficiencies, roll d6 to determine loss.
    * 16-19: Players choice.
    * 20: Lost any one step. 
    
# Mechanics
---
Checks:
* Targets a certain difficulty.
* Meeting the difficulty means the action succeeds.
* Beating the difficulty by more than 6 is a critical success.
* Rolling the max result on more than half the dice automatically counts as a critical success, if the result would have been a normal success.
* A Critical failure occurs when you miss the check by 6, or more than half the dice roll their minimum value, excluding dice who's maximum value is one.   

Dice Splitting:
* Action can have the dice used to roll them split into smaller dice. This is used to increase the average roll.
* Each split allows you to split one dice into two smaller dice. These smaller dice must be as equal as possible.
    * A d8 splits into 2d4.
    * A d3 splits into a d2 and a d1.
    * A d1 always rolls a result of one. 
        * d1 are never counted for critical failures or successes.
    


Movement:
* You must take a action to move. 
* You get an amount of movement equal to 2 + your Body, but you may perform check against the total distance you wish to move if is in more than this amount.
  * Failing this check makes you winded for a number of rounds equal to amount you missed the check by plus 1, Conferring a -1 to all actions. 
  * Your movement falls short, equal to the amount you failed plus one. 

Rounds:
* 1 Action per turn.
* Each action can have a single trivial action performed with it for no penalty.
* 2 Actions can be combined into a single action if they do not rely on the same parts of the body, but both actions take a -2. (Moving, and Shooting.)
  * When two actions are combined they are resolved at the same time. 
  * Negative effects caused by failures are applied to the other check.
  * IE, if you fail to gain extra movement with a movement action, the penalty for winded is applied to the action it was combined with. 
  * (This can cause some pretty bad outcomes, if you say failed to move and that caused you to strain your self in another action, both negative outcomes would feed into each other )
* You may take an additional action a turn, it confers either a -2 on all actions being taken, or a -5 on the additional action being taken.
    * This must be declared at the start of the turn, otherwise the additional action takes a -6 and is considered a **snap** action.
    
Attacks:
* Target specific attributes, acting as a check vs the targets difficulty for that attribute. 
* The standard difficulty to hit a stat is the double value of the stat.
* A hit allows the attack effect to happen.
* Missing the check causes the attack to miss the intended target.
